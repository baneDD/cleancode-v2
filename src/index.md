Hi there, and welcome to my website! My name is Bane and I am a Toronto-based software development consultant. I have spent a better part of the last two decades working on, architecting, leading and discussing software projects. My passion for code quality means I continuously strive to produce code that’s clean, concise, readable, modular and performant. I love improving tools and processes around writing quality code and optimizing architecture for scalability, reliability and performance.

Software engineering is a field where continuous learning is paramount in order to keep abreast of the new technologies, tools and methodologies. It has been demonstrated by  that teaching others deepens your own understanding of the subject and improves knowledge retention. With those benefits in mind, I created this blog intent on disseminating some of the knowledge I’ve acquired over the years. Hopefully you will find it interesting and informative!
